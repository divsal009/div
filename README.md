                             Brain Tumor Classification
A Brain Tumor Classifier that can classify tumor into 3 classes: Meningioma, Glioma, and Pitutary, if present when given an MRI image of brain.We have used fine-tuned ResNet50 Neural Network architecture with almost 99 % Accuracy achieved by applying the method of Transfer Learning.


                                     Dataset
We have used brain tumor dataset posted by Jun Cheng on figshare.com.

This brain tumor dataset containing 3064 T1-weighted contrast-inhanced images from 233 patients with three kinds of brain tumor: meningioma (708 slices), glioma (1426 slices), and pituitary tumor (930 slices).
